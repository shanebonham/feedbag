# Feedbag

Feedbag provides a way to allow users to provide feedback for [HelpSpot](http://www.helpspot.com/) interactions. Users follow a link marking the agent reply as good, okay, or bad, and can leave an optional note explaining. An admin dashboard shows feedback across the organization, or filtered for agent, status, etc.
