# Feedbag

Feedbag provides a way to allow users to provide feedback for [Helpspot](http://www.helpspot.com/) interactions. Users follow a link marking the agent reply as good, okay, or bad, and can leave an optional note explaining. A dashboard can show feedback across the organization, or filtered for agent, status, etc.
